Discipline Fusion Assessment
===

Here are some tests that one can run in order to determine whether a multidisciplinary team is operating is a "fused" manner.

But first! Let's get some terms down.

Terms
---

Team - A group of individual people working together to achieve an outcome.

Project - A set of work that intends to achieve an outcome. A team works on a project.

Product - A valuable artifact, created or maintained by a team. A project may create a product, update a product, or 
create more than one product.    

Discipline - A distinct branch of knowledge used to perform work on a team.

Fusion - The state in which a team is integrating multiple disciplines successfully.

Stories - A discrete slice of work that can be performed. Stories are preferably written from a user's perspective.

Tests
---

#### Access Time
Do all the disciplines integrated on the team have instant access to each other?

#### Regular Interdisciplinary Contact
Do individuals working within a discipline have meaningful (project-related) encounters with individuals working in 
other disciplines at least once throughout the day?

#### Shared Conceptual Model
Do all the disciplines share the business object model and use it to communicate concepts? When the model needs to be 
updated, do they solicit feedback from the perspective of the other disciplines?

#### Common Project Story
Can every member of the team tell the story of what the project is, and why we're doing it?

#### Implementation Autonomy
Does the team have sufficient authority to make core implementation decisions? Is there a discipline or responsibility
 that's been outsourced that regularly causes work to be stopped?

#### Line of Sight
Do all team members have clear visibility as to what the rest of the team is currently working on, including in other 
disciplines?

#### Discipline Elasticity
Can every individual member of the team leave for weeks without causing a hard block?

#### Personal Collaboration Discretion
Are team members ever penalized for stopping their own story in order to help other team members (regardless of 
core discipline)?

#### Comprehensible Work Plan
Do the stories on the project deliver strategic, experimental, or tangible value? Do they communicate to 
stakeholders what they're intended to achieve?

#### Discipline Depth
Are all of the disciplines needed for the project represented with enough depth for the project to be successful?


More Perfect Fusion

After a team has asked and answered all of the questions posed by the tests above, they will probably be looking for 
ways to improve. This section will consider each of the tests, and make suggestions about how a team can improve.

### Improving Access Time

Having fast access to team members is a major factor in team performance and success - the sooner misconceptions can be corrected, debates can be aired, and work converged, the easier it is to give a project a unified, coherent voice. The principle of continuous integration applies to concepts, design, and language just as much as it applied to technical components.

Given this, a common solution for access problems is to co-locate the entire team, and have a norm of working from the co-located space a super-majority of the time. By at least getting people into the same space, you have removed the first barrier of inaccessibility - "out of sight, out of mind".

This isn't a cure-all solution. Even in open offices, teams can develop cultures of "invisible walls", and these can take a number of forms. Some quick examples of invisible walls:
 - Team members wear headphones for long stretches of time
 - Team members work too far from each other for a quick 'across the room' question
 - Team members respond negatively to requests for a pop-up collaboration session
 
 The underlying goal here is that we want teams that have a culture where:
 - It is always ok to ask for help or feedback
 - It is always ok to respond with "I can't immediately but is it ok I reach out to you in a few minutes", or "I think this other team member might be better suited for your question, let's loop them in"
 - It is not ok to discourage team members from reaching out, even if becomes a point of stress
 - It is not ok to ask for assistance in a rude or entitled way, or in any way insensitive to the subject of the request
 
 These suggestions are built from this premise: investing in the team *is* investing in the project's success. We will trade personal performance in the moment for overall team performance in the longer term.
 
 Physical co-location isn't the only way for teams to succeed at "Improving Access Time". Some teams require a digital "co-location" approach. In order to make this work, this also requires very strong norms. Where a physically co-located team may define "core hours" that people will work on site, a digital "co-located" team may define "core channels" through which a super-majority of team communications must flow.
 
 That is to say, rather than having a room with a shared audio space where people can overhear each other, the team may have a chat channel where all project discussions occur, in a public space, so that there are opportunities for incidental overhearing. It is *very important* to minimize the number of channels the team operates through, because additional channels can easily create the same "invisible wall" problems that physical co-location has. And of course, nurturing the culture of being "available and interruptable" is just as important on a digitally co-located team as it is on a physically co-located team.
 
 ### Improving Regular Interdisciplinary Contact
 
 Its not uncommon for team members working within specific disciplines to begin to cluster together, both physically and socially. There are a number of natural causes for this behavior, and it shouldn't be considered negative unto itself - those discipline-specific relationships are the most important on a team, because they help ensure that the discipline as a whole shares a common vision.
 
 That said, when these clusters "harden", the team as a whole becomes less unified, and rather than sharing a common language and customs, the clusters develop their own independent languages.
 
 The goal of improving regular interdisciplinary contact is to create space where team members from each discipline can interact regularly and predictably, giving them opportunities to reinforce shared language, customs, and goals. This also helps share knowledge of the strengths of the team.
 
 Some tools that have been employed to improve and encourage contact are:
    
##### Scheduled Stand up meetings
A stand up meeting is a short meeting (5-10 minutes for typical size teams, max 15 for large teams) to temperature-check what's going on. A stand up meeting should include at-least every member of the team, and should have some unscheduled time available afterward for follow-up conversations. Stand up meetings where there are non-participants may not be delivering the intended value - if someone attends a stand up, they should participate, whether or not their current work is considered 'relevant' to the group. This is because the essence of a stand up meeting is discovering the *unexpectedly relevant*, and thus habits of self censorship are to be avoided. By the same token though, this is why deep dives and explorations are inappropriate for stand up and should be expressed in other meetings / rituals.
##### Story Acceptance Contact
Another way to reinforce meaningful interdisciplinary contact is to make part of the team agreement that "representatives of the other discipline(s)" are required to declare a story "complete". In this way, all work that is completed has to be described and understood by at least one other discipline, thus reinforcing a common understanding. Various flavors of this can be used depending on the shape of the project.
##### Periodic Role Swap
Another technique that can be used is to periodically move someone who works in one discipline to a different discipline. While they will have to be a junior member for the duration of the swap, this will give them the beginning of an insider understanding of what the discipline does, and the tools they use to perform the work. Of course, this should only be done to the degree it can be without adversely affecting the performance of the team.
##### Strategic Collaboration
Oftentimes, core design decisions for the product will need input from all the relevant disciplines. To ensure that all points of view are represented, create a planning cadence such that representatives of each discipline can assist in creating the story plan. Sometimes this kind of work is singular enough that it is appropriately written as a story to be executed by multiple disciplines together-as-one. It is very easy to accidentally 'freeze' a discipline out by assuming their motives, so addressing this problem is important.

### Improving Shared Conceptual Model
Operating as a unified team hinges on creating and nurturing a common project-related language. Each project evolves a series of concepts and nouns that describe its landscape. These will frequently relate to describing a process that the project is intending to improve in some way. This set of terms and relationships is a conceptual object model, more commonly known as a business object model, and must be easy to comprehend for the users of the product. It is important for the object model to be well curated because it ultimately becomes the language of the product.
Properly understood, this model is and must be a shared artifact that all disciplines use in order to execute work - because the model is fundamentally abstract (it should be easily regenerated with a white board and a marker), versions of it will appear in all artifacts related to the project. For example, the model will be expressed in:
- Value Stories (at the absolute highest level)
- User Stories
- Product mock-ups
- User interviews
- Software user interfaces
- Hardware user interfaces
- Source code
- And even more.
 
 It's fairly easy for disciplines to fall out of sync on their understanding of the the object model. For example, the design group's understanding of the users can easily run far ahead of the software development group. Or, a converse example, the software development group may have to modify the model because some of the relationships were too loosely defined, and they failed to test those changes back against the design group's understanding. Given enough time and weak communication, small differences in the model's understanding can lead to inconsistencies in the product that have a high user impact. They can also sour a collaborate relationship between disciplines into a negative adversarial one.
 
 So what to do? How does a team get better at this? A few suggestions follow.
 
 Gathering together a workable (and disciplinarily diverse) subset of the team, and brainstorm to think of all the "nouns" associated with the project. Depending on the depth of the domain, this may take a good amount of time, so it's probably good to timebox each session to about an hour. This is a good time to do some preliminary grooming - if two terms mean the same thing, see if the group can cull one of them. The nouns may be referred to as "business objects", "domain objects", or "entities".
 After coming up with an initial list of nouns, the next step is to start illustrating the natural relationships between these entities. The goal is to force the relationships to be strict, and thus clear. In order to bring some of that rigor, make sure that the quantities of the relationship are expressed - for example, a "kitchen" can have "n" plates; a "plate" can hold zero or one "dishes". This numerical relationship can help clarify how a team may be using the term slightly differently.
 
 You'll want to run these exercises periodically with your team (in various configurations). Over time, the team should be able to illustrate the entities and the relationships in a very short amount of time, and terms that were once controversial should become normed.
 
 There are follow up exercises that will help test and exercise this domain model as well, including storytelling (using the model to describe a user's way of interacting with the model), event-storming (formalizing how actors interact with the domain model by formalizing events and commands used in the user's story), and deeper product visioning (exploring the "what will have to change about this model in two years" problem).
 
 ### Improving Common Project Story
 
 If your team is having trouble telling the story of the project, the problem usually starts at the top. Every project has one or two people who effectively are responsible for owning the project - they are responsible for the investment in the project and thus must know the underlying reason for the investment. If the person perceived to be the "owner" in this sense does not fulfill both of these responsibilities, then it is probably time to find the true "owner", or find a way to bring those responsibilities to the expected owner.
 
 But knowing the product owner is just the beginning. In theory, the person acting in this role should be able to give you a high level version of "why the project exists". Usually, the first versions of this story will either be hyper brief, or, more commonly, excessively scattered. An engaged product owner will often have *so many ideas* about the potential of the product that listening to them explain it can confuse the listener.
 
 To help find the story, work with the product owner to find the center tent-pole value. What is the core feature that gets them excited? And, as a follow on, what are the kind of people the project is intended to help? And do they know people in that category personally? Broadly speaking, you should be able to summarize the whole project as "we're going to help PERSON do TASK..." followed by a description of how the project will improve or make possible the task at hand. Every project has one of these at its center, though it is normal and appropriate to have other derivative projects with their own statements in the periphery. While these stories are relevant, it's important to ensure that the main story of the project centers around one core piece of value. Because if the center does not hold, then the other stories will have to shift as well.
 
 Getting a short and strong version of this story into the heads of the team is the next step. Generally, it should be impossible to overdo this. Building versions of the story into natural team rituals can go a long way here. Some examples:
  - recapping the story at the beginning of any iteration review
  - Using a micro version of the story as a stand-up sign-off
  - In any story card review meeting, always rhetorically justify the story card by connecting it to the big story.
  - Putting versions of the story on physical artifacts in the team space, with iconography reinforcing it
  - setting aside regular all-hands meetings to recap and Q+A on how the work connects to the story
  
 None of these techniques are mandatory - they're all just tools to help socialize and communicate that high level story. At the point where they feel onerous or oppressive because the team already knows the story, switch or remove the tool you're using. If they feel painful because the team *does not believe* that story, then there's a deeper problem at hand and your team has probably entered into the proverbial "death march". Dealing with that situation is outside the scope of this paper, but is worthy of further discussion. 
 
 *NOTE Feels like this section needs to use the term persona somewhere
 
 ### Improving Implementation Autonomy
 
 Its a common story - week after week, stories are blocked because of a handful of things your team feels powerless to change. And the longer it goes on, the less invested in the success of the project your team gets - how could they be invested, when the work they do can be rendered meaningless in an instant. Worse still, the teams knows that all the blame for when the product has problems or fails will fall square on their shoulders, despite their best efforts.
 
 Responsibility is a two way street - if the team is going to be blamed for a problem, then they need the power to address the problem. When a team finds itself in the aforementioned situation, consider clarifying the powers that the team needs in order to eliminate the underlying issue. If there are things the team feels it is not allowed to change, then the team must acquire the authority to change these things. The process of doing so will look different organization to organization, but if this power/blame discrepancy is not addressed, it will be a source of decay in the team until the project ends. Consolidating this power should actually be a higher priority than technical work to fix or work around any problems (within reason - do not allow your customers to suffer). This is because there will always be another patch or emergency work-around, but a team unable to deal with root causes may make things work with intermediate fixes, and foster deep long term problems.
 
 Having gathered the authority to make changes, the team will need to consider some high level options:
 
 - Are there alternate vendors for the feature provided by the blocking resources? What are the costs of switching?
 - Would the team be better served by providing the feature itself (by absorbing the existing system, or by building a new one)?
 - Can the feature be eliminated entirely?
 
 Note that all of these questions should apply to any kind of externalized functionality - be it interface design, hardware design, software integrations, or QA. Some of these can be disciplines that have the option of being folded into the team... but keep in mind the effort required to properly fuse. It is good and appropriate for things that have clearly defined independent scope to be outsourced... right up until it becomes critical for the project and/or an unreliable resource. By critical, I merely mean that trying to separate the design of a project from the implementation of a project into two teams is fundamentally inappropriate because, at their core, they are the same project and the team composition should reflect that. A more appropriate example of outsourcing might be having a team that provides a SSO product, that may integrate into a different product. Because SSO is merely a feature of the different product, it has a coherent demarcation between the two systems, which allows more independence and substitutability (using other SSO vendors, for example).
